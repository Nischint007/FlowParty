🌊 Flow Party — A Creative Web Recreation

A pixel-perfect, animation-rich recreation of a No-Code Awwwarded website, built entirely from scratch using GSAP, Lenis, and Vanilla JS.

🎨 About the Project
Flow Party is a vibrant and dynamic website that I recreated from the ground up as a personal challenge and portfolio piece. The original site was built with No-Code tools and recognized by Awwwards, but I rebuilt it entirely with code, using:

⚡ Vanilla JavaScript

🌀 GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

🧵 Lenis (Smooth Scroll)

💅 Custom HTML5 & CSS3

This project showcases my ability to turn award-winning designs into real, performant, and immersive web experiences — from scratch.

✨ Key Highlights
🔁 Fully recreated scroll-based animations using GSAP timelines

💻 Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile

🧠 Attention to interaction details and smooth micro-interactions

🎯 Performance-first implementation with Lenis.js and smooth UX

🛠️ Hand-coded structure, no frameworks or site builders used
